# Text generation in keras

### Package Requirements:
* Keras 2.1.2
* Tensorflow 1.3.0
* numpy
* hdf5
* Python 3.6
* torch 0.3.0

The models were trained on gtx 1060 using lstm to generate text from book [alice's adventure in wonderland](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11).

Keras: ```[Keras_model.ipynb]```(./keras_model.ipynb)

Pytorch: ```[PyTorch_model.ipynb](./torch_model.ipynb)```

## Sample Output
